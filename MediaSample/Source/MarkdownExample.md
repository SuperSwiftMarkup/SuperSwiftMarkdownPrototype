5. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
6. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.

    - The Tao doesn't take sides; it gives birth to both wins and losses.
    - The Guru doesn't take sides; she welcomes both hackers and lusers.
    - The Tao is like a stack: the data changes but not the structure; the more you use it, the deeper it becomes; the more you talk of it, the less you understand.
2. Item Two—Overflow Text—The subject for history is not man's will itself but our presentation of it.
    - On the eighth of September an officer--a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him--entered the coach house where the prisoners were.

# Lists

## Syntax

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   - Alpha!
   - Beta!
   - Gamma!
   - Delta!
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

1. Make my changes
    1. Fix bug
    2. Improve formatting
        - Make the headings bigger
2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request
    * Describe my changes
    * Mention all the members of my team
        * Ask for feedback

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

# Tables

## Syntax

Colons can be used to align columns.

| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
